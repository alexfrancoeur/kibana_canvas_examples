If it seems reasonable and appropriate, than we usually ask that the total energy/water use is divided up between the different buildings by square footage and each building be reported separately with that noted in comments section.In this case, as these buildings are all residential usage, I would say take whatever joint meters they have and divy out the energy usage by a ratio of square footage.
