If they have multiple parcel numbers, than just list all of the parcel numbers in the _Boston Energy Reporting ID section with a comma in between However if you have multiple separate buildings that all share energy use and have joint meters that can't be separated, it gets more complicated. If it seems reasonable and appropriate, than we usually ask that the total energy/water use is divided up between the different buildings by square footage and each building be reported separately with that noted in comments section.In this case, as these buildings are all residential usage, I would say take whatever joint meters they have and divy out the energy usage by a ratio of square footage.
